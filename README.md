<h1> <b>Molecular Ecological Network Analysis (MENA)</b> </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This repository contains code related to the investigation of Eukaryote-Prokaryote interactions through Molecular Ecological Network Analysis (MENA) and network analysis techniques. MENA is a computational framework commonly used in microbial ecology to examine complex relationships and interactions between taxa of biofilter microbial profiles.</p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The MENA algorithm was applied to a dataset representing the relative abundance of species across different depths (2 cm, 6 cm, 8 cm, 12 cm, and 23 cm) and time points (5 weeks, 9 weeks, 12 weeks, and 23 weeks), encompassing 75% of the samples. </p>
