<h1> <b>Molecular Ecological Network Analysis (MENA)</b> </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This repository contains code related to the investigation of Eukaryote-Prokaryote interactions through Molecular Ecological Network Analysis (MENA) and network analysis techniques. MENA is a computational framework commonly used in microbial ecology to examine complex relationships and interactions between taxa of biofilter microbial profiles.</p>
